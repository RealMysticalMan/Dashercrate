      Dashercrate Rules
    </h1>
    <p>
      Don't submit hacked records <br>
      Be nice <br>
      ALL levels must be decorated in some form <br>
      Levels must be verified unless impossible <br>
      Please provide screenshot/video evidence of the level you want to be put on the community list. If not, your level won't be added to it. This also works for the main list. <br>
      No level is allowed to be copied or stolen from another level, and will be removed from the list. <br>
      Scroll clicking, and other unnatural forms of clicking, are not allowed and will not be put on the list. <br>
      Follow these rules and have a nice day <br>
