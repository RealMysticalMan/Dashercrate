# Dashercrate
The official Dashercrate GitHub repository. Dashercrate is managed by a small team serving for a small community.
The main file is `Website.html`
The file for the impossible levels is `The Impossible.html`
# Database
The database files: `playersnlevels.sql`
`questions.sql` are the exact same questions asked in the Google form on `https://sites.google.com/view/Dashercrate`. I know Google Sites has a bad rep and the domain is not good, but at least it's something to have along with this Github respository. It could be much worse anyways. After all, without Google Sites and a team of absolutely brilliant people, this couldn't have happened in the first place and that is something to honor.
