# Dashercrate

This is Dashercrate on GitHub, the official new repository coded from scratch.
Use the Issues tab to suggest features, find and inform me of bugs, and more.

## Hosting

Dashercrate uses Google Sites for hosting: `https://sites.google.com/view/Dashercrate`
We know Google Sites has a bad rep, but what else would we use for hosting if we don't have any money anyways?
Oh yeah and I also set up Google Analytics for the Google Site so that is slightly exciting but it is also embarassing because we get to see how few people actually look at the website.
