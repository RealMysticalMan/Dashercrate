# Dashercrate

This is Dashercrate on GitHub, the official new repository coded from scratch.
Use the Issues tab to suggest features, find and inform me of bugs, and more.

## Hosting

Dashercrate uses Google Sites for hosting: `https://sites.google.com/view/Dashercrate`
We know Google Sites has a bad rep, but what else would we use for hosting if we don't have any money anyways?
